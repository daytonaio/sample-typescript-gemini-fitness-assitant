## Repository URL

The source code for this project can be found at the following GitHub repository:

[daytonaio/sample-typescript-gemini-fitness-assistant](https://github.com/daytonaio/sample-typescript-gemini-fitness-assistant)
```

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Open Using Daytona

1. **Install Daytona**: Follow the [Daytona installation guide](https://www.daytona.io/docs/installation/installation/).
2. **Create the Workspace**:

   ```bash
   daytona create https://github.com/daytonaio/sample-typescript-gemini-fitness-assistant
   ```

3. **Set Up Environment Variables**:

   Before running the application, you need to set up the environment variables. Follow these steps:

   1. **Create a `.env` file** in the root directory of the project.
   2. **Add the following environment variables** to the `.env` file:

      ```plaintext
      DATABASE_URL = your_mongodb_url
      GEMINI_API_KEY = your_gemini_api_key
      JWT_SECRET = your_jwt_secret_key
      ```

      Replace `your_mongodb_url`, `your_gemini_api_key`, and `your_jwt_secret_key` with your actual MongoDB URL, Gemini API key, and JWT secret key.

   3. **Save the `.env` file**.

   These environment variables are essential for the application to run correctly and securely.

<!-- 4. **Generate Prisma Client**:

   After setting up the environment variables, you need to generate the Prisma client. Run the following command:

   ```bash
   npx prisma generate
   ```

   This command will generate the Prisma client based on your Prisma schema, allowing you to interact with your MongoDB database using Prisma. -->

4. **Start the Application**:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

The Fitness Assistant project leverages a modern and efficient tech stack to deliver a high-quality application. Below are the key technologies used:

- **Node.js**: A powerful JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 engine, used for building the server-side of the application.
- **TypeScript**: A statically typed superset of JavaScript that enhances code quality and maintainability.
- **Express.js**: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.
- **Prisma**: An ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool that simplifies database interactions and ensures type safety with TypeScript.
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database that stores data in JSON-like documents, providing flexibility and scalability.
- **Gemini API**: An external API used to fetch fitness and nutrition data, enabling personalized advice for users.
- **Daytona**: A development environment that simplifies the process of creating, managing, and deploying applications.

This combination of technologies ensures that the Fitness Assistant application is scalable, maintainable, and easy to develop.

## Using Postman for API Testing

You can use Postman to test the API endpoints provided by the fitness assistant application. Follow these steps to set up Postman for testing:

1.  **Install Postman**: Download and install Postman from the [official website](https://www.postman.com/downloads/).

2.  **Import the API Collection**:

    - Open Postman and click on the "Import" button.
    - Import the provided Postman collection file (`postman_collection.json`) from the project repository.

3.  **Set Up Environment Variables**:

    - In Postman, go to "Environments" and create a new environment.
    - Add the following variables to the environment:
      - `baseUrl`: `http://localhost:8080/api/v1`
      - `jwtToken`: Your JWT token obtained from the sign-in route.

4.  **Testing the Endpoints**:

    - Use the imported collection to test the various endpoints.
    - Ensure you have the `jwtToken` set in the environment for authenticated routes.

By using Postman, you can easily test and debug the API endpoints to ensure they are working as expected.
